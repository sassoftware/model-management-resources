# Overview

This directory contains sample data and models for the Python and R programming languages. You can use these samples to perform various tasks
with SAS Open Model Manager and SAS Model Manager. To begin using the sample data and models, retrieve the files in the manner you prefer and place all of the files in the same directory location.


## Python Models

The following sample data and models are available in the [Python Models](./Python_Models) section of the samples directory:

* For a Scikit-learn decision tree, see [DTree_sklearn_PyPickleModel](../samples/Python_Models/DTree_sklearn_PyPickleModel)
* For a gradient boosted decision tree with XGBoost, see [Gradient_XGBoost_PyModel](../samples/Python_Models/Gradient_XGBoost_PyModel)


## R Models

The following sample data and models are available in the [R Models](./R_Models) section of the samples directory:

* For a decision tree using an R model, see [DTree_Rmodel](../samples/R_Models/DTree_Rmodel)
* For a logistical regression using an R model, see [LogisticReg_Rmodel](../samples/R_Models/LogisticReg_Rmodel)

## Workflow Integration

The sample workflow definition (BPMN) file in the [Workflow_Integration](./Workflow_Integration) section of the samples directory 
is an example of a simplified workflow for sending KPI alerts via email when monitoring performance of models.
